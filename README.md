Banana Run
==========

###What is it?

Banana Run is an Android Application that makes running fun again. Created for a project at UC3M, Banana Run has grown to be an excellent piece of software everyone can use to track their daily running activities.

###Features

 - GPS tracking
 - Fragments
 - Maps
 - Live tracking on map
 - Awesomeness
 - TTS (Text To Speech)
 - Sqlite databases

####Small disclaimer

Ass you may imagine, this is far from perfect so there maybe one or two little bugs around we didn't get to fix before releasing.

Also, the app was originally called DietApp but we had to change the name of the app during development, so there may be a few places that __Banana Run__ is reffered to as __DietApp__

###Installation

So you want to fiddle with our app? great, there are a few previous steps you may have to follow to get everything up and running:

1. Download eclipse and API:15 (Android 4.0.3)
2. Download the app from github ```https://github.com/SpongeSoft/DietApp/archive/master.zip```
3. From the SDK manager, download Google play Services and add it as a project to your eclipse workspace, next to DietApp.
4. Right click on the DietApp project > Properties > Add Google play Services as library
5. Add your Google Developer Key so maps can be displayed!
